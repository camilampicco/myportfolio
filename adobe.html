              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>The PRM  Program was designed to uncover key insights into how partners interact with Adobe products, 
                identify pain points, and inform product decisions that drive engagement and satisfaction. <br>
                <br>
                This program was designed for Adobe to enable their clients to share marketing assets with their own customers, 
                provide visibility into deals and their status, and simplify the communication of updates and news, particularly 
                during campaign heavy months such as Christmas and New Year.</p>

              <h2>My Role</h2>
              <p>I led the end-to-end research process, from scoping objectives to recruiting participants, 
                executing interviews and usability testing, and synthesising findings into actionable recommendations. <br>
                <br>
                My primary responsibility was to act as a communication bridge between the PRM provider and Adobe. 
                On one hand, I collaborated with the PRM vendor using technical terminology and by reviewing the backend code of the system. 
                On the other hand, I worked directly with Adobe to understand their user-facing needs, 
                clarifying what could or could not be achieved within the PRM's capabilities.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once we aligned on goals and defined what was feasible, I recruited participants and test the program.</p>

        <h3>Likert Scale Evaluation</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to interviews and usability testing, I designed and ran a short 
          Likert scale survey to capture quantitative insights. Participants were asked:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>“How satisfied are you with the PRP?”</em></li>
          <li><em>“Why did you give this score?”</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This allowed us to measure perceived satisfaction, identify gaps between 
          expectations and experience, and validate qualitative findings with numerical trends.
